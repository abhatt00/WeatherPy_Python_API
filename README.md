## WeatherPy

Utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API and the citipy library to accomplish the objective.

Your objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

# Analysis

1st Observation: The only discernable trend occurs in the Latitude v Temp plot, where it shows that the closer a city is to 20 degrees N of the Equator, the higher the Maximum temperature is for that city. This is shown by the upside-down "V" shape in the scatter plot. 


2nd Oberservation: Although the Latitude v Humidity plot does not show a very strong trend, there is cause to argue that there is a higher frequency of cities that experience humidity the farther North of the Equator a city is. A good way to make a comparison is measuring humidity of the cities in question during different seasons.


3rd Observation: It seems that regardless of Latitude, cities are more likely to experience average wind speeds between 0 and 4 MPH.
