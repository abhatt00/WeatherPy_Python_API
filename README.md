## WeatherPy

Utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API and the citipy library to accomplish the objective.

Your objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude


# Analysis

1st Observation: The only discernable trend occurs in the Latitude v Temp plot, where it shows that the closer a city is to 20 degrees N of the Equator, the higher the Maximum temperature is for that city. This is shown by the upside-down "V" shape in the scatter plot. 


2nd Oberservation: Although the Latitude v Humidity plot does not show a very strong trend, there is cause to argue that there is a higher frequency of cities that experience humidity the farther North of the Equator a city is. A good way to make a comparison is measuring humidity of the cities in question during different seasons.


3rd Observation: It seems that regardless of Latitude, cities are more likely to experience average wind speeds between 0 and 4 MPH.


## Generate Cities List
Cities are generated from a combination of 1500 latitude and longitude points. All unique cities are appended into a list to run through the API.

## Perform API Calls
 These cities are cycled through the OpenWeatherMap API until 500 cities are found that have all relevant data points available in the API.

For each city, the data points gathered are each put into their own list.

These lists are combined into one DataFrame, which is utilized to create scatter plots that will showcase the relationships we want to emphasize.

Scatter charts are created using Matplotlib.
